:: This trait is meant to create a common interface that can be used to get
:: bytes into a ByteStream.Reader, including compatibility with efficient
:: patterns that write directly into a buffer from an I/O or network stack.
:trait ByteStream.Source
  :: Emit zero or more bytes into the given buffer starting at the given offset,
  :: possibly expanding the size of the buffer if that turns out to be needed.
  :: Returns the number of bytes that were written.
  :: Raises an error if the source has become permanently closed off.
