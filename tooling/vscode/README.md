[![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/savi-lang.savi.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=savi-lang.savi)

This extension adds to VS Code syntax highlighting and various Intellisense features for the Savi Programming Language.

## Prerequisites

This extension uses the `savi` binary to run the Savi language server in the background, so you'll need to have a working installation of Savi (see main README), with the intended `savi` binary in your `PATH`.
